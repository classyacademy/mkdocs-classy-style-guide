# General

## Capitalization

For article and course titles, use title case.

For product copy, use sentence case.

Do capitalize product names or to match UI elements. If an element uses all caps, use title case.

**Examples**

- Essential Crowdfunding Tips (title case)
- Essential crowdfunding tips (sentence case)
- Classy Pay (product name)
- Create New Campaign (button that is all uppercase is made title case)

## Contractions

Use them! Theyâ€™ll give your writing an informal and friendly tone.

The only exception is when you need to be serious or provide empahsis.

**Examples**

- Theyâ€™re going to the store.
- Donâ€™t forget to check out our new courses.
- Do not share your API key with anyone. (separated to provide emphasis)

## Abbreviations

Spell out abbreviations or acronyms the first time the audience sees them.

Then switch to abbreviations for future references.

The exception is if the abbreviation is well known.

**Examples**

- First use: A better pick is Registration with Fundraising (RWF).
- Second use: RWF allows people to fundraise leading up to your event.
- Exception: A custom block allows you to add HTML and CSS.

## Slang and jargon

Write in plain English. If you need to use technical terms, offer a brief definition.

Slang is only acceptable if universally understood or well defined through context.

**Examples**

- Add a Hero Image (the main image on your campaign page).
- Ready to dive in? Great, to get started...

## Emojis

You can use emojis in very specific casual instances.

These are okay to add a little flair to in-product messages, etc.

Use them sparingly and at the start or end of sentences for screen readers.

**Examples**

- ðŸ‘‹ Hello!
