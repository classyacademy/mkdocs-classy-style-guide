# Formatting

## Bold

Use bold for emphasis or to call attention to something. Don't overuse it or it will disrupt readability. Items to bold include:

- Product elements
- Nav items
- Key info — e.g. a specific ID

## Italics

Try not to use italics, especially in product copy. Use bold to provide emphasis or color for distinction instead. There are cases where italics can help in articles or web copy (book titles, etc.). But use sparingly.

## Underlines

Only use underlines for links — do not use underlines for emphasis.

## Sentence list

Listing up to 3 items in sentence format is okay (sometimes called run-in lists). But don't go over 3 — it makes the content difficult to understand and remember. If the items are important, a bulleted or numbered list can be the better choice.

See the [Rule of 3](https://copyblogger.com/rule-of-three/)

## Bulleted lists

Use bulleted lists when the order doesn't matter. These are also called unordered lists.

**Example**

Make sure you have your:

- keys
- phone
- wallet

## Numbered lists

Use numbered lists when the order matters — e.g. steps in a sequence. If you're giving instructions, start list items with an action verb (imperative).

**Example**

To create a campaign:

1. Log in to Classy
2. Go to Campaigns
3. Select Create

## Other list tips

**Focus on one item at a time**

Provide clarity by focusing on one item or action at a time. There are some exceptions, but this approach is a good starting point.

**Keep lists short**

Try to avoid lists that have more than 8 items. Break lists into sections if you need to cover a lot of items.

**Use parallel structure**

Keep the structure of your lists consistent—if you start an item with a verb, do the same with the rest.
