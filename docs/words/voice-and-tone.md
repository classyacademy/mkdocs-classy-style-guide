# Voice and tone

## Voice

### We listen

**Description**

Before we write, we take time to understand and relate to our audience's lived experiences. We account for their actual day-to-day challenges, passions, and goals.

**How it sounds**

We get where our customers are at in their fundraising journey and keep content relevant. We know the obstacles that small teams face compared to large ones. We know that mature teams don’t need to go over the basics again and again.

### We keep it practical

**Description**

We value honest and useful content. We do not use fluff or cheap emotional appeals. We're also aware that the ideal is not always practical. Our customers live in a world muddled by hyperbole, upsells, and false promises. We offer them a break from the bulls\*\*t.

**How it sounds**

We provide content that is concrete and actionable. When content is conceptual, it's still tied to a practical action that will benefit them now or later. We do not market or sell things unless it will provide a tangible benefit, and we are honest when it won't.

### We translate

**Description**

We value clarity and are not impressed by jargon. We believe useful content is understandable, and our job is to make difficult concepts easy and actionable.

**How it sounds**

We speak to our customers like people and in terms they understand. We do not use unnecessary jargon or vague and inaccessible words. When we teach new terms, we offer a clear and relatable definition.

### We have fun

**Description**

We play with language and actions to create moments of joy. We prefer wit over anything synthetic. We allow ourselves to be weird and eccentric but charming. We are not snobby and we always bring customers in on our jokes. We never force humor.

**How it sounds**

When we provide humor, it’s because we genuinely think it’s funny. We do not try too hard and our humor is never condescending or at the expense of customers. Our humor is subtle and is more like a wink to the audience vs a shout. We also only joke when appropriate.

### But above all else we help

**Description**

When customers interact with our content, they feel that our singular goal is to help them do something valuable. It can be as big as reaching a business goal or as simple as editing a spreadsheet.

**How it sounds**

No challenge is too big or too small for us. At the same time, we’re honest about whether the challenge is worth worrying about. We tell people upfront if their challenge is tied to another root problem they should be fixing. At the same time, we’re never snobby about our technology expertise. If someone needs help copy & pasting, we’ll help them.

## Tone

The Classy education tone is usually informal but still professional.

### It’s always more important to be clear than entertaining

We write with style but do not sacrifice substance. We know that just because something sounds good doesn’t mean it’s helpful. Substance comes first and then we add style.

### Our tone is empathetic

When writing, consider the audience and their state of mind.

- Are they new to Classy and online fundraising?
- Are they worried about launching their campaign?
- Are they confused and looking for help?
- Did they just end a successful campaign?

Adjust your tone to match their emotional state.

### Be yourself and have fun

We have a sense of humor, so feel free to be funny when it makes sense.

Never force humor. Keep it real and be yourself.
